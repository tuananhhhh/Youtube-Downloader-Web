# Youtube-Downloader-Web
This is the first project of my 30 small project I do in my spare time! Have fun!

Language: HTML and Python 
Using Flask as backend

I want to keep it as simple as possible because I do not have much time to develop it. 
Still room for development in front end and UI in the future.

Useage: 
1. Just copy your URL video link on Youtube
2. Paste it to the entry box
3. Press Download button
4. The website will do the rest. The video will be downloaded to your computer
